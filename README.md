Hi thanks for downloading my Folder organisation script. Before you get started and try and adapt this onto your own machines there are a few steps you must first complete. 

For Mac Users (if Windows search Google for how to complete the following):
Step 1:

Install Pip on your machine if you haven't already done so

Step 2:

Install Watchdog by running the following command:

	pip install watchdog

If this doesn't work try
	
	python -m pip install watchdog

Step 3:

Open the script and change each of the folder names to valid locations on your own machine

Thanks for reading, if you experience any issues feel free to contact me on my email jasonc10@hotmail.com. I will try my best to help.
